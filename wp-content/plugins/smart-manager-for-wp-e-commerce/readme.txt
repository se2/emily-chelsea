> I would happily pay five times for this product!
> What really sold me on this was Bulk Edit. My assistant does not have to do any complex math now (earlier, I always feared she would make a mistake)! With Smart Manager, she has more free time at hand, hence I asked her to set up autoresponder emails for our customers. The response was phenomenal. Our repeat sales were up by 19.5%.

> We have over 6000 individual lines on our site and this has saved us huge amounts of time.
> Bulk edit works flawlessly, which is a massive time saver. If you need to change all of your prices on the entire site by a % or value, you can with a couple of clicks! We updated the Tax > class on all products in less than 3 minutes. The CSV export tool actually works unlike some I have tried, with all 6000 odd lines neatly exported in one attempt. No missing or corrupt data.
