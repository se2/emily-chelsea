Restrict access to any WooCommerce product, depending on the ownership and/or purchase of other required products.


== Description ==

Looking for a way to restrict product access in WooCommerce? Don't want to set up a full-fledged [memberships](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-memberships/) site?

This tiny plugin allows you to restrict access to any WooCommerce product, depending on the ownership or purchase of other, required products.

Features:

* **Conditional product access** based on the ownership and/or purchase of other required products.
* Support for "ownership", "purchase" and "ownership/purchase" dependency types.

Developers can checkout and contribute to the source code on the plugin's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/somewherewarm/woocommerce-product-dependencies/).

**Important**: Requires WooCommerce 2.2+. WooCommerce 3.0+ or higher recommended.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin.
2. Go to your WordPress Dashboard and then click **Plugins > Add New**.
3. Click **Upload Plugin** at the top.
4. Click **Choose File** and select the .zip file you downloaded in **Step 1**.
5. Click **Install Now** and **Activate** the plugin.


== Documentation ==

Dependencies are evaluated when customers attempt to add a product to their cart. If validation fails, the product cannot be added to the cart and a notice is displayed. In order to evaluate "Ownership"-type dependencies, customers are prompted to log in.

= Creating Dependencies =

To add dependencies to a product:

* Go to the **Product Data > Dependencies** tab.
* Use the **Product Dependencies** field to search for and add some products and/or variations.
* Choose a **Dependency Type**.
* **Update** to save your changes.

The "Ownership" dependency type is evaluated by checking if the customer has purchased a required product in a previous order. The "Purchase" dependency type requires the customer to have a required product in the cart in order to purchase the dependent one.

= Ownership vs Purchase =

The plugin allows you to select between 3 different dependency types:

* **Ownership**: Access is granted only to customers that already own any of the products added to the Product Dependencies field.
* **Purchase**: The product can be purchased only in combination with any of the items added to the Product Dependencies field. Ownership is not taken into account.
* **Either**: Access is granted with ownership or purchase of any item added to the Product Dependencies field.


== Screenshots ==

1. Product dependencies can be created from the **Dependencies** tab, found under **Product Data**, and adding products/variations to the **Product Dependencies** field.
2. If the ownership and/or purchase conditions are not met, products with dependencies cannot be added to the cart and a notification is displayed.
